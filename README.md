## In this project, I performed a comprehensive analysis of Diwali Sales Data using Dask to handle the large dataset efficiently. The objective was to derive insights into customer purchasing behavior, sales performance, and demographic trends during the Diwali season using scalable data processing

## Conclusion
 The analysis revealed that gender, socio-economic class, and age were key factors influencing survival on the Titanic. Women, children, and first-class passengers had higher survival rates. The Random Forest model performed better than Logistic Regression, highlighting the importance of these factors.
